# TASK-2
Titanic Survival Analysis
This project analyzes the Titanic Dataset obtained from Kaggle using Python, Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib. The objective is to explore passenger demographics and identify key factors that influenced survival during the Titanic disaster.

Project Overview:
- Loaded the Titanic dataset from Kaggle
- Explored the structure and contents of the dataset
- Cleaned the data by handling missing values (especially Age)
- Performed exploratory data analysis to answer survival-related questions
- Visualized insights using Seaborn and Matplotlib
- Documented all steps using Markdown in Jupyter Notebook

Key Analysis Performed:
- Compared survival rates between male and female passengers
- Analyzed how ticket class (1st, 2nd, 3rd) affected survival chances
- Grouped passengers by age and examined survival trends

Data Visualization:
- Bar Chart: Survival count by gender
- Bar Chart: Survival count by passenger class
- Histogram: Distribution of passenger ages

Technologies Used:
- Python
- Pandas
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook
